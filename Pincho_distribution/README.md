# Pincho_distribution
This is for manipulating our lab's software called Pincho (de novo transcriptome assembler)

We use Pincho in our lab, our own transcriptome assembler and annotator. My job as a member of our lab, is consistent upkeep of Pincho, making necessary edits, and de-bugging.
In my own time, I am experimenting with dockerizing Pincho to make it more accesible and GUI friendly.
